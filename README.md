# openCV
Messing around with some basic stuff

- convolution.py: computes some basic operations with given kernel on given images

- rotate.py: just basic 90 degrees rotation of images

- rotateOp1.py: attempt of improve performance on rotate.py

- video.py: just some basic video capture script

- anagram.py: simple algorithm to find the anagrams of a given word
